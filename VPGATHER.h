// File:
//     VPGATHER.h
// 
// Abstract:
//     An interesting way to determine the accessibility or validity of virtual addresses
//     before they are truly accessed. This allows for a much stealther way to determine
//     if an address is accessible, as it does not affect the state or page table entries
//     pointed to by the virtual address. 
// 
//     This proof of concept was made strictly for educational purposes, I am
//     in no way responsible for any software that might implement this functionality
//     for any other purpose.
